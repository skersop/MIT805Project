# MIT805 Project
This repository contains my submission for the MIT805 project at the University of Pretoria.

The goal of this assignment was to use MapReduce algorithms and visualisation techniques to uncover previously hidden information in the data.

I worked with the eCommerce behavior data from multi category store dataset from kaggle.com, which can be accessed at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mkechinov/ecommerce-behavior-data-from-multi-category-store?resource=download&select=2019-Oct.csv.
