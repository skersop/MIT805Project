# MIT805 Project
This repository contains my submission for MIT805 Assignment 2, completed as part of my MIT Big Data Science degree at the University of Pretoria.

The goal of this assignment was to use MapReduce algorithms and visualisation techniques to uncover previously hidden information in the data.

I worked with the **eCommerce behavior data from multi category store** dataset from **kaggle.com**, which can be accessed at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mkechinov/ecommerce-behavior-data-from-multi-category-store?resource=download&select=2019-Oct.csv

Part 1 of the assignment entailed writing MapReduce algorithms in java, which I executed using the script run.sh on an Ubuntu virtual machine. Part 2, the visualisation component, was completed using the script Visualisation.R, which I executed using RStudio.

Discussion of results can be found in the files:
